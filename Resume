    <h3>Work History</h3>

        <div id="work">

      <ul>
        <li>Current Employer: Blattner Energy Inc.</li>

          <p>Renewable Energy Construction Company specializing in large scale commercial Solar and Wind Farms.</p>

        <li>Position: Quality Systems Administrative Assistant</li>

          <p>April 2016-Present</p>
          <p>Primary Responsibilities:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Maintain quality systems documentation for all field personnel (as many as 30+ active jobs).</li>
              <li>Develop solutions using VBA in Word and Excel for over 240 electronic forms within a Laserfiche repository.</li>
              <li>Main point-of-contact for all project-specific documentation-change needs.</li>
              <li>Maintain Quality Systems documentation within the Blattner Intranet.</li>
              <li>Report generation and distribution, typical administrative assistant duties (meeting coordination, written communication in all forms, general "customer" service).</li>
            </ol>

        <li>Skills gained/Special Projects:</li>

          <ol>
            <li>Self-taught Visual Basic for Applications using internet resources such as Stack Overflow, as well as utilization of good old-fashioned books.</li>
            <li>My visual basic skills were put to the test while converting over 240 paper-based documents to e-forms that could be filled out on a tablet in MS Word or Excel. One issue I had to solve was as follows; 

              <ul>
                <li>Problem: Forms are password protected to ensure version control, but we wanted to be able to have the user add a page specifically for photos, without having to know the password to unlock the document.</li>
                <li>Solution: I was able to achieve this by saving a template of the photo page to each user's C: Drive.</li>
                <li>In the form, when the user clicked the command button, Word would 

                  <ol>
                    <li>open the template document,</li>
                    <li>copy its contents,</li> 
                    <li>unlock the form,</li> 
                    <li>paste the photo page to the location specified within the document,</li>
                    <li>close the template, and</li>
                    <li>re-lock the form with the password.</li>
                </ol>

            <li>A brief screen video of the photo page button in action, as well as a clear button I developed to erase a signature from an InkPicture control:</li>
                  </ul>
