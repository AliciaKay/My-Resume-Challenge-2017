        <h4>Quality Systems Administrative Assistant</h4>

          <p>April 2016-Present</p>
          <p>Primary Responsibilities:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Maintain quality systems documentation for all field personnel (as many as 30+ active jobs).</li>
              <li>Develop solutions using VBA in Word and Excel for over 240 electronic forms within a Laserfiche repository.</li>

        <h4>Skills Gained/Special Projects:</h4>
<div id:="projects">
          <ol>
            <li>Self-taught Visual Basic for Applications using internet resources such as Stack Overflow, as well as utilization of good old-fashioned books.</li>
            <li>My visual basic skills were put to the test while converting over 240 paper-based documents to e-forms that could be filled out on a tablet in MS Word or Excel. One issue I had to solve was as follows; 

          
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
            <p>Forms are password protected to ensure version control, but we wanted to be able to have the user add a page specifically for photos, without having to know the password to unlock the document.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <p>I was able to achieve this by saving a template of the photo page to each user's C: Drive.</p>
            <p>In the form, when the user clicked the command button, Word would:</p> 

                  <ol>
                    <li>open the template document,</li>
                    <li>copy its contents,</li> 
                    <li>unlock the form,</li> 
                    <li>paste the photo page to the location specified within the document,</li>
                    <li>close the template, and</li>
                    <li>re-lock the form with the password.</li>
                </ol>

            <p><strong>A brief screen video of the photo page button in action, as well as a clear button I developed to erase a signature from an InkPicture control:</strong></p>
